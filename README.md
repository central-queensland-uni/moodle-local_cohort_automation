# Moodle - Cohort Automation #

The purpose of this plugin is to automate the addition of users to a cohort within [Moodle][moodle] by comparing the profile field of a user to a regular expression. 

By automatically adding users to a cohort the user can be automatically enrolled in courses within Moodle that are associated with the cohort. 

The initial version of this plugin has been developed by [NetSpot Pty. Ltd.][netspot] with the kind contribution of the [Teaching and Learning Centre][tlc] at the [University of Canberra][uc].
